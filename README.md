Hierachy:

* Sym: symbols like u, d, coordinates, color/spin indicies

* Elem: Symbol + coordinate and color/spin subscript.  

* Term: a vector of Elems; a combination of quarks, gamma matrices, propagators, xxx. e.g. uBar g5 u  e.g. `- g5_{s0,s1} Pd(x,y)_{c0,c1, s1,s2} g5_{s2,s3} Pd(y,x)_{c1,c0, s3,s0}`

Note that an Elem can contain a minus sign which is represented by a '-' at the end of the vector

* Op: a vector of term
